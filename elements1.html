									<p><strong><u>Objective:</u></strong></p>
									<p>This analysis aims to identify key factors driving bike sales, including customer demographics, purchasing patterns, and preferences. The insights gathered will help refine marketing strategies, tailor product offerings, and improve overall sales performance.</p>

									<p><strong><u>Analytical Approach:</u></strong></p>
									<ul style="padding-left: 20px;">
									<li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong>The dataset was checked for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the analysis.</li>
									<li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong>Customer demographics, purchase frequency, and income levels were analyzed to uncover meaningful trends. The impact of age, income, and commute distance on bike purchases was also examined.</li>
									<li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong>Pivot charts were used to present key findings clearly, enabling better interpretation and data-driven decision-making.</li>
									</ul>

									<p><strong><u>Key Highlights:</u></strong></p>
									<ul style="padding-left: 20px;">
									<li><strong>Impact of Income on Sales:</strong>Customers with higher income levels were more inclined to purchase bikes. Male buyers showed a slightly higher average income than female buyers.</li>
									<li><strong>Age-Based Buying Trends:</strong>Middle-aged individuals emerged as the dominant buyers, whereas adolescent and elderly groups had lower purchasing rates.</li>
									<li><strong>Effect of Commute Distance:</strong>Short-distance commuters (0-1 miles) exhibited the highest likelihood of purchasing bikes, with sales tapering off for longer commutes.</li>
									<li><strong>Education and Occupation Influence:</strong>Customers with advanced education and professional careers were more likely to purchase bikes, presenting a key segment for targeted marketing.</li>
									<li><strong>Regional Sales Distribution:</strong>North America accounted for the largest portion of sales, suggesting a strong market presence, while other regions showed lower engagement.</li>
									</ul>
									<p><strong><u>Results and Recommendations:</u></strong></p>
									<ul style="padding-left: 20px;">
									<li><strong>Target Middle-Aged Consumers:</strong>Since this group represents the majority of purchases, advertising and promotional efforts should be tailored to their needs and preferences.</li>
									<li><strong>Premium Offerings for High-Income Customers:</strong>Customers with higher earnings tend to spend more, indicating the potential success of premium bike models and exclusive offers.</li>
									<li><strong>Commute-Based Marketing Strategies:</strong>Emphasizing the benefits of cycling for short-distance travel can enhance sales, particularly among urban commuters.</li>
									<li><strong>Geographical Expansion Strategies:</strong>Strengthening the brand's footprint in North America while exploring opportunities in underperforming regions could boost sales.</li>
									<li><strong>Enhanced Digital Marketing Campaigns:</strong>Leveraging online and social media marketing targeted at professionals and educated individuals could drive higher conversions.</li>
									</ul>

									<p><strong><u>Conclusion:</u></strong></p>
									<p>This analysis provides valuable insights into bike sales trends, consumer demographics, and purchasing behaviors. By implementing data-driven strategies, businesses can enhance customer targeting, 
									refine marketing efforts, and ultimately increase sales. Pivot charts played a crucial role in visualizing these findings, supporting informed decision-making for business growth.</p>
