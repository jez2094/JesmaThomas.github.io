									<h2 id="content"><u>Project Overview</u></h2>

									<p><strong><u>Objective:</u></strong></p>
									<p>The goal of this analysis is to gain a deeper understanding of supermarket sales, customer buying behavior, and product preferences. </br>
									Examining the data helps uncover trends and patterns that can improve business decisions and enhance overall performance.</p>
									<p><strong><u>Analytical Approach:</u></strong></p>
									<ul style="padding-left: 20px;">
									<li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong>The data was reviewed to fix inconsistencies, remove duplicate entries, and handle missing information, ensuring accuracy and reliability.</li>
									<li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong>Total sales, profit margins, and transaction volumes across different store branches and product categories were analyzed to identify high and low-performing areas. 
									Sales trends over time were also examined to spot busy periods, seasonal patterns, and fluctuations that could guide strategic planning. Customer preferences based on gender, membership status, and payment methods were 
									explored to tailor marketing and operational strategies. Additionally, profitability across product lines and store locations was assessed to determine the most and least profitable areas.</li>
									<li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong>Pivot charts were used to present findings clearly, making insights more accessible to stakeholders and aiding in data-driven decision-making.</li>
									</ul>
